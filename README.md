Git Changelog Jenkins Plugin
===========================

Jenkins plugin to extract a changelog out of commit messages between two GIT revisions. This changelog can be postprocessed and converted
to either an human readable git changelog listing all commits, or a JIRA filter URL.
It implements basically the features of [git-changelog](https://github.com/paulwellnerbou/git-changelog) and [git-changelog-lib](https://github.com/tomasbjerre/git-changelog-lib).

## Usage

You can use this plugin either as a post-build action which will produce a file containing the jira filter and some informative lines,
or you can use it providing replacement text for the [Token Macro Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin), to send
emails, for example.

### Using a Post-build Action

The following documentation explains to set up the JIRA Filter post-build action. Using the basic changelog post-build action
is even easier, as it does not need any further configuration.

On any jenkins project using Git as Source Code Management, add "Publish JIRA Filter" Post-build Action. A form with a few
input fields appears where you can configure the behaviour. Just below the input fields their meaning and default behaviour is
explained.

If you leave the file input empty, the information will be logged into the jenkins console.

If you specify a filename, you can use other plugins like [HTML Publisher Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin)
to save the files as jenkins report.

### Using as Token Macro Replacement Provider

Having installed the [Token Macro Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin) plugin (which will be the case, as it is a dependency of this plugin), following macros for replacement are provided: <code>GITCHANGELOGJIRA</code> and <code>GITCHANGELOG</code>.

If you use these macros in any plugin supporting token macro replacements, this will be replaced with either the Jira URL or the changelog.

The [Email-ext plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin) supports token macros, so you can include this URL
in an automatically sent email.

## Development

This plugin can be built and started with maven and Jenkins' hpi plugin:

```
mvn clean install
./run.sh
```

The run scripts opens a debug port on 8000.

The functionality is implemented in [git-changelog](https://github.com/paulwellnerbou/git-changelog). Pull requests are welcome!
